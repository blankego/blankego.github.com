## Who am I
My name is Thatch Acre, well, not exactly the original version, It's a calque from my Chinese name. And I certainly have not only a pair of mirrored name have same meaning, I also took other identities when I hang around on the web. Some most used out of many are Blankego, Fermtect, Charmquark, 希夷先生. Yes I'm a Chinese boy, not a young one though. I'm interested in a lot of things, like science, linguistics classical Chinese philology/philosophy, history, esoteric cultures, and stuff. My major is computer science, specifically the software development. I am a polyglot programmer, especially good at Javascript, python, C# and C++, I think I'm allowed to say I excel in these languages, I also speak ruby, vala,  java, bash, awk, haskell, yes you may retort, awk is not a full-fledge language, but it's turin-completed, isn' it? I mentioned it just to make the point: I'm a linux guy, I like to work on and play around with a linux box. I'm a eager learner and a greedy exploiter, I like to squeeze the machine too make it produce more juice :) No I'm not a sadist. I'm just greedy.
