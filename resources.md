### Javascript
Javascript may be not a fancy language, but it's definitely a fun one. It's so dynamic that you can tweak it however you like to do all kinds of nasty tricks, as long as the brower says okay. Yeah, the browser's compatibilty is always the pain in the ass. I bet you've been haunted by it for long time. Guess what, it won't quit, you will likely keep being bothered by it, for the foreseeable future. That's because the browser implementers they don't appreciate the virtue of collaboration - to make a better world? No way! They're doomed to fight each other to death. Although the fighting is bloody, the competition does have some benefits, it pushes the web to evolve.
