title: Javascript Tools
---
This is a collection of javascript tools I've made over time. All can be fired up directly in your browser, just click the following listed links. Hope you enjoy the convenience brought under your finger :)

## [Guangyun Skimmer - 廣韻查詢](/js-tools/guangyun-skimmer)
## [CCCount - 漢字統計](/js-tools/cccount)
It works like the wc command of linux, except it only counts Chinese charecters, ignores anything else, besides, for it's a javascript app, runs in browsers,as a matter of course it would provide a more friendly user interface.

(cf: [cccount project](/projects.html#cccount))

## [Universial Numerals Converter - 「萬能」數碼轉換](/js-tools/numeral)
Is does conversion among several numeral systems.

## [Linear equation solver - 直除法解方程](/js-tools/linear)
Caveat: It solves equations only in a ancient Chinese way. It's very unproductive, so don't use it in business. I made it your show merely to show how whould it be like to do math, if you were an ancient Chinese. :)
